### The challenge

- In this challenge, it was supposed to create a testimonial page, using the CSS grid tool, this way the page should be responsive and viewed on all types of devices.

## My process

- My process of building this page was relatively easy in some aspects, such as creating the testimonial articles, but I always have a little difficulty in terms of responsiveness, I created the home page for a mobile device, but when it comes to creating the site for a desktop device, I'm having trouble aligning the elements, but little by little I'm managing to develop the page.
